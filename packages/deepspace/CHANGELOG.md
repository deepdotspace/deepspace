# deepspace

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- `deepspace collaborators add <email>` can now invite someone who isn't a DeepSpace user yet: it sends them an email invitation (billed to the app owner) and they become a collaborator when they sign in and accept it. The new `deepspace collaborators cancel <email>` rescinds a pending invite, and `collaborators list` now shows outstanding invites alongside active collaborators.

### Patch Changes

- `deepspace deploy` on a repo without `DEEPSPACE_APP_ID` no longer silently mints a fresh id destined for a route-claim collision when the name belongs to an existing app. Adoption now also recognizes legacy name-as-id apps the caller deploys on-behalf (collaborator or admin): adopting an app you own stays automatic; adopting one you _don't_ own asks for confirmation (or `--adopt` for non-interactive runs); a name owned by an app you can't deploy fails up front with the real reason.

## 0.5.7

### Patch Changes

- 7301e30: Relicense to Apache-2.0 (from the next release onward), add LICENSE files, repository/homepage/bugs metadata, alpha notices, and a README for create-deepspace. Source is now published to the public mirror repo at https://github.com/deepdotspace/deepspace on every release.
