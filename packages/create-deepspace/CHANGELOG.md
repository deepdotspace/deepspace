### Patch Changes

- Make silent failures visible. `RecordProvider` now accepts an `onWriteError` prop (`(error: WriteError) => void`, where `WriteError` is `{ kind: 'permission' | 'validation', title, detail }`) — previously the friendly-error pipeline (server rejection → `parseServerError` → callback) was unreachable from the public API, so a denied or invalid optimistic write looked like a success with no signal anywhere. Unhandled rejections fall back to a loud `console.error` explaining how to wire real UI (note: this fires in production too — existing apps that never wired a handler will start logging rejected writes to the console; each unique error logs once, repeats are suppressed), and the starter template routes `onWriteError` to its toast system out of the box (permission → warning toast, validation → error toast). On localhost, a signed-out `RecordProvider` without `allowAnonymous` renders a visible diagnostic instead of a blank page (production still renders nothing), and passing `schemas` alongside `roomId` (where it's ignored) warns once; both diagnostics can be forced on or off via `globalThis.DEEPSPACE_DEV = true | false` (LAN/tunnel previews, consumer test suites). `deepspace dev` and `deepspace deploy` now run schema lint up front and print findings (e.g. a `visibilityField` no role enforces) in the terminal, capped at 5 with an overflow count — previously these only appeared in the worker console after a client connected.
