# create-deepspace

## 0.9.0

## 0.8.2

## 0.8.1

### Patch Changes

- Align the CLI's esbuild dependency with Vite 8 and pre-approve the required esbuild and workerd install scripts in generated npm 11 apps.
- Make Codex, Claude, and ordinary Git worktrees first-class. DeepSpace now validates Claude paths against Git metadata, isolates ports for every linked checkout, retains externally managed worktrees, creates managed worktrees outside the invoking client checkout without shared dependency links, refuses lineage-losing detached deploys, and scopes ephemeral credential helpers per worktree. Fresh scaffolds finish dependency installation before their initial commit, preserve existing agent metadata and launch configuration, and keep neutral agent instructions canonical.

## 0.8.0

### Patch Changes

- Install Framer Motion only when adding the landing-page feature instead of including it in every new app.
- Windows support fixes. `deepspace create` now runs the scaffolder correctly (it exec's `npx.cmd` via cross-spawn instead of exiting 1 with no output) and reports a spawn failure instead of swallowing it. Scaffolded dependency installs are reliable and observable on Windows: the install runs in the foreground rather than a detached worker that the terminal's job object could kill mid-install, and the log-tail hint is PowerShell-aware (`Get-Content -Wait`) off Windows and `tail -f` elsewhere. CLI error paths (workspace/deploy/pull/push/clone and any escaped error) now stop the active progress spinner before exiting, so an expected error exits cleanly instead of aborting with a libuv assertion. Cross-platform path and process spawning throughout.

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- Rework the scaffolder around a clean starter and a template system.
  - The starter template is rebuilt on a Base UI-backed primitive kit (Dialog/Modal, Select, DropdownMenu, Popover, Tooltip, Tabs, and form controls) with a minimal, unopinionated shell, so scaffolded apps start from a neutral base and design their own look.
  - `npx create-deepspace` now assembles apps from a shared base plus per-template overlays. Choose a template with `--template <name>` (or `-i` for an interactive picker); `starter` remains the default.
  - New `copilot` template: a three-panel shell (collapsible sidebar, a main content panel, and an AI chat dock) with light and dark themes.

### Patch Changes

- Condense the scaffolded CLAUDE.md (starter and copilot templates) to a lightweight pointer at the deepspace skill — the single source of truth for agent instructions. The removed sections (build workflow, static vs dynamic pages, UI placeholder rules) all live in the skill's SKILL.md and references; CLAUDE.md keeps the skill-loading block, a short "About this project" (including which template the app was scaffolded from), and "Project commands".

## 0.6.2

### Patch Changes

- RecordRoom now gates its HTTP debug API (`/api/debug/*`) behind `ALLOW_DEBUG_ROUTES` at the Durable Object's own ingress, matching the app-worker proxy gate. Enforcement lives at the one place every caller funnels through, so it can no longer be bypassed by a caller that forgets to gate. The platform's shared-data rooms hard-disable the debug API entirely. No change for apps that already gate via the proxy.
- Refresh the AI chat model lineup to the current generation. ChatPanel's default picker and the scaffolded starter's `ALLOWED_MODELS` now offer Claude Sonnet 5 (new default), Claude Opus 4.8, Claude Haiku 4.5, and the GPT-5.6 family (Sol / Terra / Luna) alongside GPT-OSS 120B; the retired-generation entries (Sonnet 4.6, Opus 4.7, the GPT-5.4 picker rows) are dropped from the picker, while their ids stay server-allowlisted. The scaffolded chat route now sends `reasoningEffort: 'none'` for OpenAI models — GPT-5.6 on /v1/chat/completions rejects function tools otherwise ("Function tools with reasoning_effort are not supported"). Apps scaffolded before this release that upgrade `deepspace` must add the new model ids to their `ALLOWED_MODELS` in `src/ai/chat-routes.ts` AND add the same `providerOptions: { openai: { reasoningEffort: 'none' } }` to their `streamText` call for OpenAI models (or pass their own `models` prop to `ChatPanel`) — otherwise the picker's new ids are rejected with a 400 by design, and GPT-5.6 turns with tools error.

## 0.6.1

### Patch Changes

- Make silent failures visible. `RecordProvider` now accepts an `onWriteError` prop (`(error: WriteError) => void`, where `WriteError` is `{ kind: 'permission' | 'validation', title, detail }`) — previously the friendly-error pipeline (server rejection → `parseServerError` → callback) was unreachable from the public API, so a denied or invalid optimistic write looked like a success with no signal anywhere. Unhandled rejections fall back to a loud `console.error` explaining how to wire real UI (note: this fires in production too — existing apps that never wired a handler will start logging rejected writes to the console; each unique error logs once, repeats are suppressed), and the starter template routes `onWriteError` to its toast system out of the box (permission → warning toast, validation → error toast). On localhost, a signed-out `RecordProvider` without `allowAnonymous` renders a visible diagnostic instead of a blank page (production still renders nothing), and passing `schemas` alongside `roomId` (where it's ignored) warns once; both diagnostics can be forced on or off via `globalThis.DEEPSPACE_DEV = true | false` (LAN/tunnel previews, consumer test suites). `deepspace dev` and `deepspace deploy` now run schema lint up front and print findings (e.g. a `visibilityField` no role enforces) in the terminal, capped at 5 with an overflow count — previously these only appeared in the worker console after a client connected.
